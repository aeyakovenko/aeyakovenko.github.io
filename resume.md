   * Proficient in Python, Ruby, Clojure (a Lisp variant), BASH,
     Nemerle (an ML variant), and some assembly (ARM, hexagon).
   * Years of experience debugging heterogeneous cores in a multi-OS
     environment using T32 and GDB.
   * Worked on projects of all sizes (some over 9m lines of code).
   * Developed components for both a micro-kernel and monolithic
     operating systems.
   * Developed on Windows, Linux, Android, QNX, Cygwin, OSX, NetBSD.
   * Committed to bug-free code via automation and 100% code coverage.
   * Enjoy developing AI algorithms, back-propagation, Markov models,
     Bayes inference.

### EDUCATION ###
   * University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Bachelor of Science
     in Computer Science, 2003

### WORK EXPERIENCE ###
#### Engineer, Qualcomm, San Diego CA, December 2003 to Present. ####
   * Developed a bridge between the DSP co-processor and application 
     processor for high performance hetergenous compute applictions: 
     filed for 2 patents, ported drivers to Android, Windows and QNX.
   * Developed a dynamic module framework for loading shared objects 
     on DSP from the applicatin processor.
   * Developed an interface description language compiler for 
     bridging environments in a memory effecient way.
   * Developed a capability based application framework for BREW -
     Qualcomm's mobile operating system.
   * Developed a declarative object library for C with C++ compatible
     v-tables, multiple facets, weak references, disjoint inheritance
     trees in a single heap node - in less then 500 bytes of RO arm
     object code.
   * Developed a tool for tracing system calls in BREW with an 
     embedded Lua interpreter as a programmable front end.
   * Developed tools for manipulating symbols in execultables for post
     build customization.
   * Developed a prototype and test generation tool for rapid
     development of BREW components.
   * Implemented network components using SIP/HTTP/RTP and proprietary
     standards for QChat push to talk service.
   * Developed high performance logging tools to handle tens of
     thousands of transactions per second from many networked
     components.

#### Founder/Developer, IContrib, San Diego CA, 2012. ####
   * Founding member of a web platform for managing donations.
   * Developed a web back-end for handling transactions.

#### Founder/Developer, Alescere LLC, Lisle IL, 2001 to 2003. ####
   * Founding member of a VoIP startup.
   * Implemented SIP and RTP protocol stacks, and server components
     for a VoIP system for small businesses.

#### Research Assistant, Senior Design, UIUC, 2003 ####
   * Developed a web server that supports out of order requests.
   * Developed a probabilistic scheduler for the Linux kernel.
   * Implemented a roaming protocol for 802.11a/b networks for NetBSD.

#### Personal Research ####
  * Used implemented and optimized, neural networks, genetic
    algorithms, Markov chains, and Bayes inference algorithms,
    over gigabytes of data entirely for fun.

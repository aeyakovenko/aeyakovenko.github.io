### WORK EXPERIENCE ###
#### Engineer, Qualcomm, San Diego CA, December 2003 to Present. ####
   * 2011 - Present. Hexagon DSP SDK.
      * High performance RPC between application processor and dsp.
        10-fold reduction in latency over 3 previous implementations,
        2 patents.  Drivers for Android, Windows Phone and QNX. (C)
      * Module framework for dynamically loading shared objects on
        dsp. (C)
      * IDL compiler. (Haskell targeting C)
   * 2005 - 2011.  BREW/BMP (mobile OS kernel developer)
      * Code
         * RPC implementation for process, co-processor (with
           different instruction sets), as well as languge and
           network boundaries. (C)
         * Kernel and user space service frameworks. (C)
         * Device driver framework. (C)
         * Byte code for low-memory rpc. (Haskell targeting any
           language)
         * Declartive C objects with C++ compatible v-tables,
           multiple facets, disjoint inheritance trees in single heap 
           node. Less then 500 bytes of RO arm object code. (C)
      * Tools
         * IDL compiler. (Haskell targeting C/C++)
         * STRACE tools for on device debugging. (Haskell and Lua)
         * ELF manipulation tool for post build image modification. 
           (Lua)
         * IDL based component and test generation tool for rapid
           prototyping. (Haskell + Lua targeting C/C++)
         * Dynamic module configuration tool. (Lua)
      * Optimizations
         * Assembly optimizations for RPC invocations from user to
           kernel.
         * Optimized stack usage during on demand dynamic module
           loading.
         * Code generation optimizations for performance and stack
           and heap usage for the C IDL backend.
   * 2003 - 2005.  QChat, "Push to Talk" server
      * Implemented network components using SIP/HTTP/RTP and
        proprietary standards. (C++)
      * Developed high performance logging tools to handle tens of
        thousands of transactions per second from many networked
        components. (C++)

#### Founder/Developer, IContrib, San Diego CA, 2012. ####
   * Founding member of a web platform for managing donations.
   * Web backend developer. (Haskell)

#### Fonder/Developer, Alescere LLC, Lisle IL, 2001 to 2003. ####
   * Founding member of a VoIP startup.
   * Implemented SIP and RTP protocol stacks, and server components
     for a VoIP system for small businesses.  (C++)

#### Research Assistant, Senior Design, UIUC, 2003 ####
   * QoS for the Apache Web server. (C).
   * Implemented web server that supports out of order requests. (C++)
   * Probabilistic scheduler for the Linux kernel. (C)
   * Roaming protocol for 802.11a/b networks for NetBSD. (C)

#### Personal Research ####
  * Used and implemented and optimized, neural networks, genetic
    algorithms, Markov chains, and Bayes inference algorithms,
    over gigabytes of data entirely for fun.  (mostly Haskell, some
    of everything)

I am a software developer with over 10 years of experience working on embedded systems. Over the past 3 years I designed and lead development of a brand new technology for co-processor communication between ARM and DSP cores on Qualcomm chipsets, for which I was the lead inventor on several patents.  We achieved a tenfold reduction in co-processor communication latency, which enabled cutting-edge uses of the DSP, and enabled technologies that would simply not be possible without leveraging the DSP's performance and power efficiency.  

I would be an asset to any team trying to take full advantage of the computational resources available on Qualcomm mobile processors. I would love to continue my role as a lead, taking on exciting engineering challenges and pushing the power and performance limits of mobile processors. 

I would be thrilled to work on optimizing hardware performance for the Oculus Rift. I will follow up with you next week, and you can reach me at aeyakovenko@gmail.com. I look forward to speaking with you.

Thank you,

Anatoly Yakovenko
